This example uses the following files/layers:

  virtual_crystal_chamber/vc_160x80_purple.pqf
  battery_overlay/batt_160x80.pqf
  logo_wipe/logo_wipe_160x80.pqf

Note that in this example, the virtual crystal chamber handles on, off, clash, drag, melt and lockup effects internally, so there is no extra files for those.

To use these files, simply copy the 160x80 directory to your font or common folder on your SD card.
